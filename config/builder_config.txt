# This config file contains parameters used by PPL when your project is built.
# Look at the example assignments below and modify them if needed.
# Note: Comment lines start with #

# java_exe_options
# ----------------
# This parameter defines the 'java' executable options applied when your application is launched.
# Please refer to Java's official documentation for a full list of options supported.
# By default no value is assigned to this parameter
# example:
# java_exe_options = -Xmx384m -Xss16m

# Windows_run_file_name and Unix_run_file_name
# --------------------------------------------
# These parameters define the file names for the Windows and Unix/Linux OS script files that launch your application.
# If this value is not explicitly set then (by default) the file name is the project identifier suffix (e.g. 'qwe.bat' and 'qwe.sh' for project 'qwe').
# Note: If you change these values then you must also adapt the file name used inside your system script files located in your project's root directory (e.g. 'run.bat' or 'run.sh').
# examples:
# Windows_distribution_run_file_name = my_file_name.bat
# Unix_distribution_run_file_name = my_file_name.sh

Windows_distribution_run_file_name = sim.bat
Unix_distribution_run_file_name = sim.sh
